# DESgeo
"The Game that changes, you just never know when it will."  The cryptonym DESgeo comes from two ideas... One. DES, which stands for "Data Encryption Standards" and here is an acknowledgement of the early 1970's development.  Two. geo, which is of Greek origin and here literally means "Earth-Like".

Why SIGNA?  Why not!  SIGNA was originally BURST, which went through a rebrand.

I am a fan of short Block-times.  I know there are others that are faster, but for what I do on the Signum Blockchain the short Block-time
works even with x confirmations.  I can speed the confirmations up to x, but that isn't always necessary.

So I heard you're interested in seeing a White Paper.  Currently a White Paper, Yellow Paper, and Red Paper are being worked on without a deadline.  
There is no deadline because the projects collaborated on move fast.  Keep an eye on the Timeline & research related Papers if you want to be aware 
of the current areas of focus.

How Long does a solid Paper need to be and what topics should be addressed?
***The original Bitcoin Whitepaper was four pages long.

White (Establishing), Yellow (Implementation), and Red (Protection).
